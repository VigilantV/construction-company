      <p>
        Although supply of material, equipment and services are part of the
        execution / implementation of each project, but it is important that,
        with proper management practices, the highest quality can be provided at
        the appropriate time of the project and at the lowest cost. This also
        depends on knowing a wide range of vendors of material and services in
        different categories. A good procurement (highest quality along with
        appropriate cost) is more to the benefit of the client when contract
        between contractor and client is in cost plus model. Also, will decrease
        the project total amount in other types of the contract and cause to
        minimize the project total cost.

          This section is one of the subdivisions of technical office and highly
          experienced civil, architectural, structural, electrical, and
          mechanical engineers working in this section. Recently, most clients
          know the advantage of working with EPC contractors, because a company
          that can perform design and engineering activities along with
          execution works can be very helpful for the progress of the project
          quickly and smoothly and prevent faults. Moreover design and
          engineering is a basic activity in all projects and a professional
          design/Engineering with a good quality will affect to the execution
          works and creates a high quality work/project. Based on mentioned
          points, HINASIAH has arranged an active and effective designing
          section as one of goals and has tried to improve the quality of this
          section. In the Resume of HINASIAH Designing section there are many
          projects in various field mentioned in the below, that have been
          designed in all disciplines including civil, structure, architectural,
          mechanical and electrical:

        <p>
          Due to the diversity of projects and since the design method for each
          type of project contains common procedure and in some parts are
          different, in the following and for more information, we declare Study
          and Design procedure of clean room spaces related to pharmaceutical
          projects: 1- Basic studies of design: The conclusion of this section
          will be Process flow diagram and report, the result of study/report of
          this section should be reviewed and approved by the client. 2-
          Conceptual design: The purpose of this section is to turn the idea
          into a plan, as well as to insert the main process and functions of
          the major components of the project. 3- Preliminary design: Carrying
          out basic engineering studies and preparing the first stage drawings,
          specifying the quantity and quality of needed spaces. In the end of
          this section, report of studies and first stage architectural drawings
          album (site and buildings), also estimated bill of quantity and a
          preliminary estimated project total cost (with accuracy of %85) will
          be prepared and submitted to the client in order to get a decision by
          the client. Although production process document should be approved by
          the general directorate for drug affairs before submitting it to the
          consultant. 4- Detail Design: Calculation and providing of detailed
          drawings, general and specific specification, bill of quantity and
          project final cost estimation as documents for
          tender/procurement/contractor selection will be submitted to the
          client. 5- Consulting services (GMP) and Qualification: Actually this
          part is coordination between Drug production process with GMP
          requirements and favorable with technical assistant and
          standardization method (SOP), also qualification of machinery and
          equipment according to the last international standards, coordinated
          with technical office and supervision of drug affair organization. To
          more clarification about Preliminary Design (PHASE 1) and Detail
          Design (PHASE 2), novak Co. has provided two flow Diagram that
          describes the activity procedure.
